## Sample Execution & Output

Run without command line arguments, using

## Observations

As in this excercise the code was almost completely given, the only things that I needed to implement were the overloading of the operators that were pretty simple.

Also I changed a little bit the way that the main printed things in the console, so now is easier to read the output.
